# MAGIC ## 1. Upload a File to Unity Catalog Volume - BYO Data - and create a new table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Download the [Product Description](https://github.com/yasmk/apj-workshops-2024/blob/main/Datasets/DI%20Platform%20Lab/product_description.tsv) file to your local computer <br />
# MAGIC 2. Navigate to the `Catalog Explorer` and find the `byo_data` volume under your catalog and schema
# MAGIC <br /><img style="float:right" src="https://github.com/yasmk/apj-workshops-2024/blob/main/Resources/Screenshots/1.2.png?raw=true"/><br />
# MAGIC 3. Click on the volume name and then click on `"Upload to this volume"` button on the top right corner<br />
# MAGIC 4. Select the `product_description.tsv` from your local computer and upload to the volume<br />
# MAGIC 5. After the upload completes, click on the 3 dot button (vertical elipsis) on the far right side of the file name and select `create table`
# MAGIC <br /><img style="float:right" src="https://github.com/yasmk/apj-workshops-2024/blob/main/Resources/Screenshots/1.5.png?raw=true"/><br />
# MAGIC 6. Leave the `create new table` option selected, then select the correct catalog and schema names from the drop down. Keep the table name as `product_description`<br />
# MAGIC 7. Examine the available data, then click `create table`<br />
# MAGIC 8. Once the table creation is complete, click on the `Sample Data` tab in the `Catalog Explorer` to see if the data was loaded correctly and is displayed as expected. <br />

# MAGIC ## 2. Add Comments and Discover Data
# MAGIC Add some comments to the `product_description` table that will help others find it, using the AI suggested comments to help out. Test out searching for this table using the "search data" bar at the top of the screen.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## 3. Ask Databricks Assistant to help you write a join between new and existing data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Open the `SQL Editor` on the Databricks Workspace menu and create a new query tab<br /><br />
# MAGIC 2. Select the correct catalog and schema at the top drop down menu<br /><br />
# MAGIC 3. Click on the Databricks Assistant icon on the left hand side of the SQL Editor window and type the prompt: **How can I join the tables dim_products and product_description to add descriptions to my products?**<br />
# MAGIC As the Databricks Assistant can provide different results every time you aske the same question, go ahead and do a few more prompt iterations to get to a usable query, if necessary. If the Assistant can give you an `INNER JOIN` query where you can replace the column names, go ahead and adjust accordingly: <br /><br />
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The final query should be similar to this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC SELECT p.*, pd.prod_desc
# MAGIC FROM apjworkshop24.<my_schema>.dim_products AS p
# MAGIC JOIN apjworkshop24.<my_schema>.product_description AS pd ON p.name = pd.prod_name
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Click on the `Save*` button at the top of the SQL Editor, name the query `Products with full Description`, and save it to your Workspace

# MAGIC 2. Configure the first task as follows:
# MAGIC - Task Name `Data_Preparation_Silver` 
# MAGIC - Type: Notebook
# MAGIC - Source: Workspace
# MAGIC - Path: navigate and select the `2.1 Data Prep - Silver` notebook 
# MAGIC - Compute: select the DBSQL Serverless cluster
# MAGIC - Click `Create Task`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Add a second task to the same Workflow, and set it as a conditional check: `if/else condition`
# MAGIC - Task name: `Status Check`
# MAGIC - Condition: Click on the link `Browse dynamic values` and copy ``{{tasks.[task_name].result_state}}``
# MAGIC - Replace the task name accordingly replacing the placeholder with the correct previous task name: `{{tasks.Data_Preparation_Silver.result_state}}`
# MAGIC - Enter `success` as the condition value
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. Add a third task to the Workflow and configure it as follows:
# MAGIC - Task Name `Data_Preparation_Gold` 
# MAGIC - Type: Notebook
# MAGIC - Source: Workspace
# MAGIC - Path: navigate and select the `2.2 Data Prep - Gold` notebook 
# MAGIC - Compute: select the DBSQL Serverless cluster
# MAGIC - Click `Create Task`
